## Introduction

As artificial intelligence continues to evolve, the need for efficient data retrieval and storage solutions becomes paramount. Pinecone offers a unique approach to managing vector data, allowing for seamless integration with various AI models. This repository serves as a playground for developers and researchers to dive deep into Pinecone's functionalities.

## Project Goals

1. **Understand Vector Embeddings**: Gain insights into how vector embeddings work and their significance in AI.
2. **Explore Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Investigate how Pinecone can enhance retrieval-augmented generation tasks.
3. **Experiment with Similarity Search**: Test and measure the performance of similarity searches using various embedding models.
4. **Develop Practical Applications**: Create sample applications that demonstrate the power of Pinecone in real-world scenarios.

## Installation

To get started with Pinecone, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kauxtubh/pinecone.git
   cd pinecone
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your Pinecone account and API key. You can sign up [here](https://www.pinecone.io/start/).

4. Configure your environment:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Pinecone API key:
   ```plaintext
   PINECONE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

Once you have everything set up, you can start experimenting with Pinecone. Here are some basic commands to get you started:

1. **Initialize Pinecone**:
   ```python
   import pinecone

   pinecone.init(api_key="your_api_key_here", environment="us-west1-gcp")
   ```

2. **Create a new index**:
   ```python
   pinecone.create_index("example-index", dimension=128)
   ```

3. **Insert data**:
   ```python
   index = pinecone.Index("example-index")
   index.upsert([(id, vector)])
   ```

4. **Query for similar items**:
   ```python
   results = index.query(queries=[query_vector], top_k=5)
   ```

## Core Features

### Vector Database

Pinecone acts as a fully managed vector database, enabling you to store and retrieve high-dimensional vectors efficiently. This feature is essential for applications that rely on embeddings.

### Embedding Models

Explore various embedding models, such as BERT, GPT, and others. The repository includes examples demonstrating how to generate embeddings from text and images.

### Similarity Search

Utilize Pinecone's fast similarity search capabilities to find items that are most similar to a given vector. This is particularly useful in recommendation systems and search applications.

### Scalability

Pinecone automatically scales to handle millions of vectors, making it suitable for both small and large datasets.

### Real-time Updates

Insert, update, and delete vectors in real-time, allowing for dynamic data management.
